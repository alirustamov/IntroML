1	B001LG945O	A2NICGGIGIFU22	Actually tastes like real oranges	I really enjoyed this soda. I used to be a big fan of Orangina a few years ago but Switch Orange Tangerine is WAY better -especially if your looking for a true orangey taste. A cold one of these would be very refreshing on a hot summer day. Tastes sort of like real orange juice mixed with seltzer, which begs the question why not just mix it yourself? (if your at home that is). But I wouldn't hesitate buying one of these when out and about. Very tasty.	0	0

1	B0007A0AP8	A134M8GHW35L42	Healthy tasty treat	My dog loves the how these treats smell and taste - they are special treats for her. They're healthy, mildly chewy, low calorie treats so it's perfect. They are a good compliment to her regular chicken jerky treats (from Canyon Creek Ranch.)<br />I usually divide each into 2 or 4 pieces while training.	2	0
1	B006ZCUUTI	A3UH5TBDOCQN9G	The File makes the gumbo!	Zatarain's is my choice for gumbo seasoning. It has a great sassafras flavor. Not too strong and adds the right texture to your gumbo.  It works well with dirty rice or any recipe that calls for file.	0	0
1	B000PDY3P0	A1JZGC3KVPAJVL	Fantastic	"We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the ""real deal"".  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he."	0	0
1	B0005YX2QA	A2NOZB6VZCTOI4	181 Years Old, And Still The Best!	"I love steak, although I don't eat it all that often anymore. When I do have a steak, though, I absolutely love the taste of A1, which brings out the best in any cut of meat. Although I am not too enthusiastic about putting it on seafood (which the label suggests as a good idea), I think it goes well with any kind of beef, and works well on chicken and turkey as well. It is an essential ingredient in many marinades, and is generally one of the most used items for meat preparation in my refrigerator.<br /><br />What many people don't realize is the long and noble history of A1, which dates to 1824. In 1824, when a king's palate reigned supreme, Henderson William Brand, chef to England's King George IV, created a sauce for King George for use on meats. King George was so impressed with it that he proclaimed it ""A1,"" and that's how the sauce got its name.<br /><br />Beyond the history lesson, though, I think King George was correct in his gustatory proclamation: this sauce really is ""A1""!"	2	0
1	B007M83302	A3IR8KHXQNV81	I see why they're called POPchips!	First and foremost, shame on me. I thought these were going to taste like dry, boring, bland chip replacements. Imagine my surprise halfway through the first bite. It has the tang of a regular chip with BBQ flavor, but has the light and non-salty taste of a healthy snack. I literally had to hide the bag to prevent eating them all in one sitting. With a nice glass of sparkling water, they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know, love, and mindlessly consume. I truly suggest you open your mind and buy a bag. These were absolutely wonderful to have as a late night snack, a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, and something to share with the children in my life. After one bag, you might not want to share.	0	0
1	B008NNXXLO	A1O377H0N716US	Big Burst!	This is the best pick me up ever if you feel like you have no energy in the middle of the day, I just brew over ice and it wakes me up without having a high calorie caffeine soda. So much flavor I have to buy more before I run out,  I hope they never stop making these and it arrive quickly!	0	0
-1	B004OQLIHK	A1XMESDTSSRZHJ	CHOCOLATE TASTES CHEAP	I thought I was purchasing a high quality item but it's not all that. The chocolate is very sweet and as you chew on this product you can tell the chocolate is loaded with sugar by the crunchy texture. I'm going to say it's not worth the money and I'm not satisfied.<br />At the same time of purchasing this product I also bought Sunmaid chocolate covered raisons which I rate from a 1-10...a 10. Now we are talking about yumminess!!!!!<br />So customers...if you are going to choose...let it be the Sunmaid...you won't be dissappointed	1	3
1	B001BDDTB2	A1BA72K4VK1UN1	My 12 cats like this product just fine (details)	"With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product! The first day, I introduced the cats to the Petite Cuisine seafood entr&eacute;es. The next evening, they got to try these two Entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the ""gravy"" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn't -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended."	2	0
1	B001MURXMK	AH15LB0KISOK2	Wow this is a ton of yummy cookies....	First and for most 4.6 lbs of cookies is A LOT of cookies. There are 12 individual packages of cookies 3 of each type in a very nice large tin. Walkers cookies are always yummy and the cookies in this tin are no exception. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who was amazing to me during a hospital stay. The tin is very sturdy and is tasteful in its decoration. This would make a perfect gift for any occasion!	0	0
1	B000DZFMEQ	AIGTRCH46ZBZ3	Awesome product	I was recently diagnosed with sensitivity to wheat (the Doc stopped short of a full celiac test and diagnosis). I used to love eating bread. This product is terrific if you follow the instructions for the machine. The last loaf I made I used olive oil instead of canola. What a difference! The problem now is how to keep a loaf for a week - it gets eaten so quickly! I thoroughly recommend Pamela's Products.	0	0
1	B000SATIZA	A1J9SP91YOMZHB	Delicious	Very tasty, kinda hard to judge how much to put in, just add more water.  Everybody drink more tea. love it.	0	0
1	B0045Z6K50	AYH8K5A9NPMNN	More bang for my buck!Q	Since we've had a keurig, we've gone through many varieties of kcup coffees including flavored and non flavored. Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, acidic, or just ordinary. We have found OUR FAVORITE with this one. It's strong, flavorful, and smooth. Comes exactly as described by the seller, order promptly processed, arrives quickly. Can't beat it in our opinion. I can recommend this coffee and the seller with confidence.	0	0
-1	B00141UC9I	A1U5TD8ZUX5N2S	Would not buy again	I ignored the other reviews about how these were now being made in China - I had checked the warnings and was comfortable that Dogswell hadn't been mentioned.  I've bought them many times, and my dog loves these treats!  Unfortunately, the most recent batch I got last week smelled really awful - like a mix of chemicals and rotten meat.  None of the bags I've gotten before smelled anything like this, and it was so strong that it filled my apartment with the odor.  I threw them out and would not recommend buying them.  It's not worth the risk.	0	0
1	B004KPFUCO	ADI9XMEGOMX2P	Finally - a sweeter I am comfortable with!	"I use this mainly for sweetning my tea.<br />Was concerned about sugar, afraid of saccharine, stevia could get bitter and had its own set of warnings.<br />Raw honey was certainly more natural, but still high glycemic.<br /><br />I was so relieved when I discovered organic Agave Nectar.<br />Very low glycemic, and sweeter than sugar or honey, so used less.<br />How deceived I felt when I started reading about *why* it was low glycemic.<br />It is really just light high fructose corn syrup! (HFCS also is low glysemic).<br />The problem with AN and HFCS is it rushes right to your liver and gets processed there!  Intakes ""may indirectly harm the liver by increasing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and elevated blood levels of triglyceride fat, all of which in turn increase the risk of liver disease."" [...]<br />So the search was on to once again find something that could sweeten up my tea and not harm me!<br />This Palm Sugar is perfect! One tsp has only 10 calories and 2.5 gm carbs, yet has a glycemic index of only 35- about the same as the now-dreaded AN, and much lower than regular sugar or honey. Also, palm sugar has a good amount of nutrients and minerals in it. While I certainly do not consider it a health food I am pleased to know that instead of impacting harm it could be doing a little good!<br /><br />Be careful of what brand you buy.<br />I heard that some american companies are mixing it with cane sugar; other brands have more calories than this organic one from Navitas.<br /><br />The taste? Perfect! Has a slight light-brown sugar flavor. Definitely does not over-power but rather enhances the drink.<br />I have not cooked with it mainly because I have not yet cooked any sweets since this arrived. Would I? Hard to say. I would love to, but I think of it as special, and not sure if I would want to waste it by having it lost in a cookie. But then that subtle flavor...I'm thinking it would be awesome in biscotti!"	24	1
1	B002ANCCK6	A3IIKMBDK9Y2HQ	My cats are Tiki Cats	I first learned bout Tiki Cat while searching for responsible and healthy food for my cats. I tried many different brands of cat food before Tiki Cat. I knew I had a hit when even my finiky cat came running for Tiki Cat food time. They seem to like the Sardines best, but I'm sure that every cat is different, and Tiki Cat has so many varities you're sure to find one your cat likes. Amazon has the cheapest price for this product, and it's delivered right to my door! I'll never have to drive to a pet store and pay extravagent prices for good cat food again!	0	0
-1	B003NY7K8A	A23UKBPWKEI7ZG	This product it not what you may think you are getting	"I enjoyed my Manicardi #8 vinegar I bought in Italy. I thought I was buying and even better quality with this product as it is advertised as #12. I was able compare them side by side and this #12 is not close to the same good flavor. I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally #12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually ""grape must"" and a condiment quality. But including the #12 designation does mislead. So I gave it one star based on the easily confused product. It was not what I was expecting so I am unhappy with the result. Others may enjoy the flavor but the real thing is much better."	0	0
1	B003UDQ5V2	A2S4YTR74OGCY5	Great food helps. The best food helps a lot.	If your dog is scratching and itching, please triple your dog's exercise and let him/her have some excitement ( A different road, a few different lanes, even a nature-spot where he/she can be off leash to feel free.)  Science says a small risk 'mastered' is great for humans, and science also says the same for dogs. The most nutritious, least tiring food helps. A lot. Great good can happen when small risks are mastered--both for humans and canines. Baby steps lead to mastery. Good nutrition helps a lot. Good, great food, no grains, and lots of chemical-free proteins add to life, Chemicals are hard on the liver and kidneys. Older dogs might need chemical drugs--but younger dogs might have options. Explore chemical-free options if your dog is young,<br />We'll all be old--let's not make our dogs older before their time with food.	1	1
1	B0002VXZ4K	A2NAGIYG83DCOH	Great Product at a Good Price	I have ordered these peanuts several times so far.  I cannot find them anywhere in the local grocery stores or specialty food shops in my area so thank you Amazon!<br /><br />The peanuts arrive carefully packed and fresh.  I will continue to order these peanuts for as long as I can.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of sushi should enjoy these.	0	0
1	B003TIVBSU	A1FNLONTI5IUY5	LOTS of vanilla beans	These beans arrived quickly and were well-packed in a vacuum sealed pouch.  There were LOTS and LOTS of long, supple black vanilla beans.  They smelled great and were very pliable.  I immediatley made some vanilla sugar, which 3 weeks into it, smells wonderful.  I intend to add beans to vodka for extract.  I also added several beans to oil to make a wonderful vanilla oil for salads.  There are so many beans, I will make a few gift budles wrapped in raffia for my family and friends.  The leftovers seem to be keeping quite nicely in my room temp pantry. I just need more ideas for the rest of the beans.	0	0
1	B008ZRKZSM	A2117APPOAZ097	Super PB2	This is the best product ever. I used to put regular peanut butter in my chocolate shakes and it would stick to the blender jar. Just add a tablespoon of this powder in the jar and blend away. It is fantastic.	0	0
1	B006WW3GYC	AYJFP2AJ5Y64L	Jelly Belly's are the Best	Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!	0	0
1	B000F0EX2Q	ASRA18Q2XKRE1	spicy peppercorns, great value	these peppercorns are fresh and spicy.  they are<br />just what i wanted.  Nice size and i think they are<br />are great value.	0	0
1	B004WM0ZTS	A2RBTO2M1DJ294	Real Coffee	Really very good. Taste is great, no weird artificial taste, no little bitty grounds floating about. This is not crunchy brown water, but an actual cup of coffee. I make it in the microwave and it's great. Get the 10 pack for 9.95 and it's less than $1/cup.	0	0
1	B006N3IG4K	AHOLU32W82TZQ	Just Right Anytime of Day!	I have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however, this is my favorite. Some I've tried are bitter; some are too light; some are too strong; but this one for me is just right! Some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured, the grounds filter out into the needle of the Keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which isn't difficult, just annoying. Never had a problem with these.  Breakfast in Bed k-cups are smooth, not too light and not too strong, right smack in the midddle. No bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day. Enjoy!	0	0
1	B000EH2QPQ	A1LO15609SA1Q3	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, QUALITY DOG FOOD!!!	I have 2 Pomeranians that both ADORE this food! They never get tired of it. Both the canned and the dry dog food, particularly the Chicken and Rice, are excellent. You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!	1	0
1	B000I1RHMU	A149YNJYQJKHXY	YUM!	Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!	2	0
1	B002HG6Z8Q	AAKO51858RQVQ	Yummy- great for parties.	These are the best gluten free cookies around. The Snicker doodles are also great! They are great to serve at parties or have for a snack. I wish they were a little cheaper, but they are worth it!	1	0
1	B002VVMAIQ	AKRLH4ZDPIPZD	Excellent bag for make up	This bag is awesome. It has shaved several minutes off my morning routine. I can see all my makeup easily. Bag folds up well with magnetic closure. Travels well. Not good if you are someone with a lot of make up. I can fit several eyeshadows, mascara, blush, under eye makeup, two eyeliner pencils, several eye shadow brushes, q-tips, and a few other items.	5	0
1	B001HTJ49G	A37CENQP0ZNKVE	Delish!	For Hi-Protein carb food, these pretzels are the best!  Crisp texture, and a nicely well cooked (burnt) flavor which brings out the best in a pretzel, you can't go wrong with these.  I like them better than any other pretzel I've have to date. If you think they are too salty, just rub the bag before opening and a lot of the salt falls off.  I'm on my second order :)	0	0
1	B000G6RYNE	A83YQC1XOU4CS	The best I've had	I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast.	0	0
-1	B001TZL6ZS	A3CN7UI4V8SDB	Chemical taste, nasty.	I am a bacon fiend and was very excited to try Baconnaise!  However, after a small taste, both my husband and I found it disgusting.  It tastes very chemically and not so much like bacon - more like smoke flavoring.  We threw it all away.	26	10
1	B0030C9A60	A22SF4XQI6LLUS	Chocolate - How can you go wrong?	Great for serving Chocolate liquor. Adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme. Being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake.	0	0
1	B004W7T9VI	A3JLECMNWC4LDY	Good orange flavor	Sharp orange flavor with a tolerable spearmint taste. I've tried many of the less expensive brands and haven't liked any other except this one and Good Seasons Tuscany. I'm not crazy about all of the Tazo drinks, but this one is nice. I love drinking this tea with chocolate. It comes in an orange package. You can also smell the other spices. Don't make the mistake I make, by adding too much water. As with many products, amazon is over charging.	0	1

1	B000FKAYO2	A2VBL3JMMB282U	Love this Product	Having an allergy to wheat, all I can say is that Tinkyada products are the absolute best.  So good that you don't even know that you are not eating a wheat pasta.  Because I'm a lazy cook, I serve this to my husband or any visitors and no one has ever known that they were not eating wheat pasta.  Love it!!!	0	0
1	B001E5E20O	AATKSSQJ7KVGW	The best Earl Grey I have had!	I am an avid tea drinker and have tried so many teas, both loose teas and bagged teas, looking for the perfect cup of Earl Grey.  Rishi hit the ball out of the park with this one.  The flavor is strong and full, but still sweet and comforting.  It is not as bitter or as harsh as many other Earl Greys.  It has a fresh taste and smell.  The tea is superbly balanced and tastes as if there is more to it than tea leaves and water.<br /><br />To compare to some other teas, to give you a better picture of what I mean, it is a fuller flavor than Bigelow, Twinnings, or Ahmad, while being not as delicate as Numi.  It does not have the synthetic taste and smell of Stash.  It is not quite as pungent and bitter as Tazo (which I do like).  Mostly, it compares to Teavana's Earl Grey Creme, which I also highly recommend, but is a more robust flavor, with less of the creamy mouth-feel.  I highly recommend this tea.	1	0
1	B001FPT2MG	A22MI212KEK07E	Excellent taste	I have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place (Bristol Farms) had closed.  I love it especially in my salad dressings.	1	0
1	B0015R9BQG	A3J4NARZK4Q4PX	Suprisingly yummy...great texture!	My daughter wanted to try these because she used to love jerky type snacks prior to becoming vegetarian. I have tried other brands of veggie snacks similar to these so I did not have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! These are yummy! Great texture & flavor. Great ingredients too! We will be stocking up on these as a healthy, convenient protein packed snack.	7	1
-1	B008EG59KS	A1RUS8VOWCIC28	Use too many chemicals (colors, preservatives) - not healthy	While taste is OK it's simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 - approved by FDA doesn't mean it's healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children.<br />If you're going to eat it yourself - take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother?	3	12
1	B001CD1VI4	AB5VA31O4NSP3	Good flavor	I decided to give these a try, but was a little nervous about the flavor -- I normally go with chocolate or oatmeal raisin. These are great! Kind of fruity, but very good.<br />I think these are perfect for mornings where I don't have time for breakfast and want something I can grab and eat while driving or once I'm at the office.	1	0

1	B000FKAYO2	A26X7W5UM5QFT4	Gluten Free?  You'll love this!	"I've known I need to remain gluten free for over 25 years now, and have tried many, many gluten free products to get as close to the old ""normal"" days as I can.  The bottom line is that my wife and I purchase the Tinkyada products almost exclusively when we buy pasta (she eats it too despite not having to be gluten free).  And getting it from Amazon make it far easier too, since we can't find most of their products in our reasonably large city - we have to drive 100 miles to the REALLY big city.  So for about the same cost, minus tax, minus travel or shipping, we get it direct and avoid extra expenses.<br /><br />As for the product, this is as good as any ""regular"" pasta I ever had in my ""past life.""  There's far less stickiness, and it holds up well for leftovers the next day.  It is not mushy or relatively tasteless like some of the other brands of gluten free pasta we've had in the past.<br /><br />When we give 5 stars, it's because it stands out as superior.  A really good product ""only"" gets a 4-star rating from us.  This one's a definite 5."	0	0
1	B000F9Z1WI	A2YB7DLC3FOR7W	Very good snack!	I really like these.  They are so light and airy, almost like chips instead of cookies!  The flavor is that yummy OREO chocolate we all know and love!	2	0
1	B003WEFSAI	A2MNB77YGJ3CN0	Good drink for peach lovers....	This is the best of the Ocean Spray sugar free flavors, in my opinion.  Of course, one of my all-time favorite flavors is peach, so this fits the bill perfectly.  I usually make up a 32-oz Nalgene bottle of the stuff, using two of the sticks, and try to drink 2 or 3 bottles a day.  It's not overly sweet, and has a strong peach flavor that doesn't taste chemical or phony.<br /><br />Amazon's price varies, so keep an eye on it.  So far, it has stayed a little below what I would pay in the local market for this, and since I can have it delivered (and with Amazon Prime, I can get it fast), it's worth it to me to purchase in bulk like this.	1	0

1	B000J23YP2	A3I6HMWP6GNICA	Great product!	This is the second time I've ordered Ouzo candies by Krinos.  A pleasant tasting little lozenge with just the right amount of anise.  Not overwhelming at all and leaves a nice aftertaste.	0	0
1	B000DZFMEQ	A20MS7IM754LLO	PIZZA FINALLY!	"You have to plan ahead a little bit, becuase the dough has to ""rest"" for an hour, but I was REALLY satisfied with the outcome. Since going gluten/wheat-free about 2 months ago, I have not had my very favorite food = pizza. Today I planned ahead and made the crust with Pamela's mix. I don't have a heavy duty mixer, so I just stirred it by hand with a wooden spoon for 3 minutes (the directions say to stir with the mixer on medium speed for 3 minutes). It turned out just fine. I used cooking spray on a large rectangular insulated cookie sheet and it browned nicely and didn't stick at all (even though my oven usually runs hot and burns). After I topped it I put it back in the oven for 10 minutes, and then slid it off off the cookie sheet directly on to the rack to crisp up a bit. It tasted great, although if I could criticize at all it was a little on the sweet side for pizza crust, but it was still great and satisfied my pizza craving."	0	0

1	B001CGTN1I	A2DPYMNI2HCIOI	Lots of benefits, especially for vegetarians/vegans!	Chia seeds are a versatile and amazing food.  These seeds from Navitas Naturals:<br /><br />1) Provide a very easy way get omega fatty acids -- your body cannot make Omega 3 fatty acids on its own and they are essential to cognitive health.<br /><br />2) Provide an easy way to get fiber -- not only does fiber help you feel fuller it can promote digestive regularity.<br /><br />3) Are easily incorporated into many foods you eat on a regular basis -- Chia seeds can be placed in oatmeal and smoothies.  Because they have a rather mild taste, you can even use them as sprinkles on a dessert. I've made a vanilla tapioca pudding with them. I also add them to salads.  Because chia seeds eventually turn into a gel if left in a liquid for a period of time, you can use them to thicken gravies.<br /><br />4)Are Vegan (and therefore vegetarian) -- Fish is how most individuals incorporate omega fatty acids in their diet.  These seeds are fish free.<br /><br />5) Provide energy -- Can be a great supplement to take before intense workouts or on days when you are feeling sluggish.  Let these seeds soak in some juice or low calorie coconut milk (like So Delicious)to help propel you through the rest of your day.<br /><br />6)Come in a bag that is resealable.  You don't have to struggle to close the bag; it opens easily and closes just as easily.	6	0

1	B000VKYKTG	A1WX42M589VAMQ	"Fun ""popping-crispy"" sticks dipped in chocolate, special treat for manga fans, but find local or wait till fall"	"Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights"" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED)."	1	0

1	B001SAYI2W	A31J176KH7ZZEY	Nice Swedish Treat!	All of my family members are fans of fruit jams, jellies, and preserves because they are versatile food products that any person of any age can consume. These food products are also friendly for people with TMJ/jaw problems as well. When I tried Hafi's Cloudberries Preserves from Sweden, I decided to try Felix's Lingonberries Preserves, too. Like the other Amazon reviewer said, if you like the taste of cranberries, then you'll probably like this lingonberries preserve. This lingonberries jam has berries in it and looks beautiful as you spread the preserves on pancakes and soft bread. It's the color red, and kind of reminds me of cranberries, the taste and look of them, especially cranberry dressing and salads during American Thanksgiving meals. Swedish lingonberries are very sweet and tart. My recommendation is to buy both Hafi's Cloudberry Preserves and Felix's Lingonberries Preserves for your household and when you're entertaining guests. Why? - because each person has different tastes, and Swedish cloudberry preserves is more mild with less tartness, and would accomodate the people who wouldn't appreciate the tartness of Swedish lingonberries. If you have both Swedish cloudberry and Swedish lingonberry preserves, then you would cover all your bases in terms of pleasing every family member and guest. When it comes to eating this jam straight from the spoon, personally for me, it is really tart, tangy, and a little strong. While with cloudberry preserves, I could probably eat the whole jar without tasting or sensing a strong tartness. Personally for me, this lingonberries preserves tastes great with vanilla yogurt; it reminds me of Yoplait's fruit in the bottom yogurts. According to Felix, on their jar, they say that these lingonberries ripen during summertime in northern Sweden. The ingredients in these preserves are: wild lingonberries, sugar, and fruit pectin. Felix also suggest putting these preserves on meat. I ordered these jars from the seller on Amazon, and they did a good job wrapping and taping bubble wrap to protect each jar from breaking during transport. Anyways, I highly recommend trying Swedish lingonberries and Swedish cloudberries preserves. Both of these Swedish treats offer different tastes that are yummy and good!	4	0

1	B0013NUGDE	A13FEDZA2FZLCC	My favorite brand of chips	"When I first heard about Popchips I thought they'd end up tasting like either kettle cooked chips or Cape Cod style chips. I was wrong. They are light, airy, and have a great taste to them... (a note to the makers of Popchips, however, there does need to be better quality control - I will randomly get a bag of chips that are, for lack of a better description I'll say ""harder"" than the majority of the batches I buy.)<br /><br />The Salt & Pepper variety is the flavor I love the most. It has a nice kick to it (if you're not into heat, you might want to stay away from this flavor and stick with my other favorite 'original'... otherwise, just have a bottle of water nearby.) I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is a lover of chips."	0	0

Even my self-proclaimed germs don't dissuade my niece and nephew from taking mine, if more isn't available.<br /><br />This is delicious, I buy it every 2-3 weeks and is my reward for exercising etc, instead of gum or candy or cake or whatever people use to motivate themselves to get to the gym.<br /><br />Spread on saltines, it's delicious, I like it with toast in the morning on oat bread with my cappuccino.  I rarely eat it as a sandwich, although its been known to happen if I stumble across cherry-100% fruit jam in the store.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate lover and I've traveled to many many chocolate-producing countries just to try their delicacies, but here I'm with Trudi.  This is a wonderful snack just to keep in the cupboard for yourself, and your spoon.	1	1

I was lured by the cute, gimmicky labeling and sold by the ingredient list, but I twice fed Merrick canned food to both of my dogs, and BOTH times, BOTH dogs were diagnosed with pancreatitis -- an illness which is dangerous,  extremely painful to the animal, and which requires hospitalization. I'm not sure if the fat content in those particular cans was high, or if Merrick uses an ingredient/additive that somehow sickened both of my (unrelated) dogs, but this food made them very ill. After their second hospitalization for pancreatitis, I spoke with other folks who had stopped feeding Merrick to their small-breed dogs for the same reason -- the food caused vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy in their pets.	5	0

1	B000I6PXLC	AF7DUY08T2J87	Good coffee, with some exceptions.	"The first batch I got must have been a bad batch, because it seemed to have a ""burned coffee"" smell, and smelled a bit more like chocolate raspberry or some other flavor rather than pure chocolate. It made me wonder whether Coffee Masters uses the same equipment to make both a chocolate raspberry flavor and the dark chocolate decadence flavor, and if the flavors got mixed during the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Since then, I have ordered it several more times and have been more satisfied with it. There are times, however, when those burned flavor notes creep back in, depending on the bag. I sometimes wonder if Coffee Masters overroasts their beans.<br /><br />I originally bought this coffee instead of the chocolate coffee I used to regularly enjoy but could not find on Amazon, Brothers Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Swirl.  The Coffee Masters Dark Chocolate Decadence bean is darker, oilier, and richer than the Brothers bean.  The Brothers bean coffee is milder, more like Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I still might prefer the medium-bean Brothers Blend over this coffee, even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean, as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am now actively seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices. Those that ignore the plight of the farmer and show no transparency in the process of the coffee from field to table I do not buy any longer. So this brand is no longer one that I will purchase. Plus they engage in farming activities that are not ecologically sound. I suggest starting with Intelligentsia."	2	0

He took to picking up the empty jug and dropping it, as if to ask for more food ... and after 3 or 4 instances of this, the lid broke.<br /><br />If the lid were better protected from this type of damage I would definitely buy another one.

I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. I will be ordering this product from now on for my family.<br />In the interest of product comparison, we have ordered Timothy's white hot chocolate, and Green Mountain Hot cocoa, Timothy's was great, but pricy, and Green Mountain didn't really taste all that great to our family. It had a watered down taste to it.	21	2

I eat a strict Paleo eating regimine <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982207786"">The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy (Primal Blueprint Series)</a>. With that I have given up dairy (the bane of our healthcare problems) and it was suggested I try Ghee which is virtually lactose free. I brush this on chicken breasts that I bake and sprinkle crushed raw sunflower seeds on top of and bake for an hour and thirty minutes or so. The taste of this ghee is wonderful after baking and the chicken crisps up just right. I have not used it for anything else, but I am sure I will."	2	0

It has all the nutrients you need and is low in calories and the taste is superb. I use it in baking and cooking with the added flavors of vanilla and coconut, it's a real treat. Really adds flavor to protein drinks, too.  The aseptic packs are great for camping and taking on the road if you have no refrigeration available.	2	0
1	B007M83302	AOSV7VXZQ1EI2	Great Flavor	I have tried a couple of flavors and the cheddar is by far my favorite.  The Sour Cream/Onion has an off-putting sweet yet salty powder.

I recommend the individual serving packs because it is very easy to eat more than one serving of the larger bags.	0	0

It's dated Jan. 2013, but it must have been stored improperly.  It has no fragrance and no taste.  Even the teabag paper looks yellowed.  It is worse than supermarket tea.

I love that they can sit on the shelf for weeks and then be microwaved quickly into a warm snack.  The hot and spicy isn't overdone - there is some heat, but you can still taste the rinds.  The heat is just enough to slow you down so you don't consume the whole bag in less than five minutes.<br /><br />I also love to hear the crackle sound when you pull them from the microwave.

-1	B004P4TL8E	A580192F8TK1J	Fell Apart	"I have never taken the time to write a review before, but in this case others need to be warned off. I expected to get a product similar to what I have seen in the stores, but this obviously is a replica. The sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before I even got it out of the package. It is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun. Even then, it is very ""sticky"" pulling the tray out because there are no rollers. It is metal on metal, which does not work well without some sort of lubrication. I love Amazon, but this product is inferior at best."	0	0
1	B00390T5JA	A1WVMU2PMQ0GXW	Wonderful machine.	The Keurig brews excellent coffee, is economical, and saves energy at the same time because one is not making a pot of coffee in order to get one or two cups of coffee.  I would make 4 cups of coffee and often wind up throwing away half.  Now I have two cups of caffeinated coffee, a couple cups of decaffeinated,  a cup or two of tea (either made with a pod or a tea bag--yes you can get just a cup of piping hot water for your tea), and hot chocolate.  It takes less than a minute to brew a cup of coffee; just enough time to go to the fridge and get the cream or milk.  We have started to use the 'eKobrew' pods, which makes it possible to make our own  blends and we do not have a little plastic pod to throw away.	1	0

It's quite large for her and I almost waited to introduce it to her until she got bigger, but she'll take the rope in her mouth and drag it all around! (Mine has the purple and white rope which seems better quality than the older style solid purple rope that breaks easily.) She knows the kibble is in there but can't seem to figure out how to make it fall out. But we play with it together and she's getting the hang of it. It's a fun toy for the both of us to play with now and once she gets older and can figure out how to get the kibble out on her own, she'll love to play with it as a distraction until I return home.

1	B000NY8ODS	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Make a fresh fruit tart, light and beautiful	"This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base."	2	0

1	B000F4H5FE	A23A3FEXAMBOIJ	Good Tea and a good buy	I was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea, not knowing if I would like it.  So I went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so I might give it a taste test.  This is quite a good green tea.  Other than buying generic green teabags, I usually buy a Bancha tea. This tea is not as grassy, more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it.<br /><br />The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh.  The only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea, altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters. Unless you really love this tea, plan on making some gifts.	10	1

1	B000M5PP8U	A281NPSIMI1C2R	Slightly Spicy	Tom Douglas, a famous Seattle chef, has created a spicy steak rub that is especially delicious. I rub this seasoning on the best filet mignon I can find. Then I cook the steaks in a little oil. One thing about this seasoning is it is made with brown sugar. This means your steak is going to burn a bit unless you keep the heat on medium or lower. When I use this steak rub I tend to cook the steaks a little on each side and then I cut them up into smaller pieces and continue frying. This guarantees that they won't burn. To be honest I can't really taste the rosemary in this mix, the peppers are much more prominent. My husband loves to eat the steaks with a little Tiger Sauce. He thinks that makes them just perfect. I have also tried the Salmon rub and the Chicken rub and have found them all to be delicious.<br /><br />~ The Rebecca Review	1	0

1	B002HQRA7G	A1HG82U7GY9531	Sweet Love = Great Coffee	After trying this coffee a few months ago from my local Sprouts Market, I was hooked! I am a serious coffee connoisseur and this by far has the most smoothest taste around. It's not oily like a Starbucks and doesn't become bitter once the bag is opened like Peets and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf coffees. It is a darker roast coffee, but I prefer those. Made with a few tablespoons (once ground) and spring water, you've got yourself one good cup of coffee. So glad to have found this on Amazon for such a great price. I will definitely be buying this again!	0	0
1	B0075AOEJ6	A2MHVPQEKTH1DS	Best Mustards EVER!	I was first introduced to these mustards in Ireland.  They are amazing and I was happy to find them on Amazon.  My favorite of the three is the Irish Whiskey flavor.  The Guinness flavor is amazing as well.  A little pricey for the amount you get (7.2 oz) but they're so good it's worth the expense.  Highly recommended!!	0	0

-1	B004JWS0CA	AU8NWWRKX07XH	Very weak	Very weak blend, slightly bitter aftertaste.  Noticeably light brew when brewing.  Won't purchase again, in fact, I regret this purchase.  Even on 4 oz brew, still really weak taste.	2	0
-1	B005LKCWU0	A2199YBFAFQFCD	Loaded with MSG	I bought this based on the rave reviews posted previously -- but one of the main ingredients is MSG. There's gotta be a way to make a good BBQ rub that's not loaded with the stuff, which gives me and my wife nasty headaches.......	0	0
1	B0001392N2	A2DAAQI25T42JS	Best Low Cal Truffle	"As a Physician and Surgeon - I am very concerned with the physical fitness of my patients. The Gayles Truffles are, without question, the best ""low cal"" chocolates I have ever tasted. My favorites are the milk chocolates, but they are all very good. Only drawback - they are expensive, and the portions are small, but satisfying.<br />Dr. J. Gerber, Los Angeles"	1	0
1	B000UZVPKO	A2C3PLPJPO1IOK	Perfect diet aid	these are really good, the sodium is ok based upon the daily allowance. It is a great fast meal when you do not want to cut on the stove and it is really good when added to a salad. so far the  low fat sardines has aided me in my weight loss, I am going to continue Roland's product until I reach my final goal weight. They taste good, a litte coarse and dry but I normally add the juice to a fork full. I love them. I learned not to be too critical and enjoy the little things in life.	1	0
1	B0001IVR8A	A3L8MZLGPZ18E4	Love this hot chocolate mix!	Dads are hard to shop for, but this was a hit for Christmas last year.  It was just a fun little *extra* stocking stuffer for dad!  Would definitely shop with this company again.	0	0
1	B000I6PXLC	A2AA1G6BYJETY1	A treat for all the senses.	Sounds corny but oh so true.  The aroma is pungent with the savory smell of coffee and the sweetness of chocolate.  The chocolate flavor is rich yet delicate so it doesn't overwhelm.  I purchased four bags of the ground coffee first for my daughter.  She insisted I taste it even tho I don't like flavored coffee or 'dark' chocolate. I enjoyed it so much I took back a bag and purchased 4 bags of the whole beans to grind when needed for that added freshness.  While I will not drink flavored coffee all the time, I feel it's a treat to start or end my day with a cup of this delicious coffee. My daughter also enjoys this coffee cold.	2	0
1	B001EO5YHK	A39L35PUI58CFY	Spicy and Flavorful...	I've given these to friends that don't eat spicy and they wanted to kill me afterwards.  Actually one person did not want to speak to me at work for a week.  These are pretty spicy.  I'll normally sit down and eat maybe 20-30 at a time and that's it.  If you're a fan of Dave's hot sauces then you owe it to yourself to get this 4 pack.  It's also a great gift or stocking stuffer.	0	0
-1	B007M83302	AQNLG42HPS5KD	Packaging is misleading	I bought a big bag of these and I don't mind the strong pepper taste. What I do mind is the bag implies these are Potato chips.<br /><br />There is absolutely no potato taste left in this snack; if you like eating extremely salty onion powder this snack is for you.<br /><br />Going by the bag I expected: REAL potatos, a little oil and baking, finally sprinkled with salt and pepper only? Not a long list with things like Cane Sugar, Rice flour, maltodextrin......list of ingredients goes on and on.<br /><br />If you're looking for BAKED POTATO, salt and pepper chips don't bother with these!<br /><br />--VS	1	5
1	B001RVFDOO	A1J4147VIML9Y4	Worth The Money!	These chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading (and unhealthy I might add)chips, but I was not disappointed in my purchase. They arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husband's lunches. Also, we checked for the closest store selling these and it was Target 50 miles away in Tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them.	0	0
-1	B001ET5XWQ	A2NXHOB9XWSXS1	Very bitter coffee.  Rude customer service!	I purchased this coffee because of the claims on the packaging that the beans were picked with integrity and with fair practices. I always look for these traits in my coffee, as well as look for organically grown beans. I also always purchase decaf and love strong, dark roasted coffees. So, I brewed this coffee in the same manner as I usually do, with a high-end coffee maker, and it was not good. It had a very, very bitter taste. Like I said, I brewed it the same as I always brew my coffee, added the same creamer, and it was horrible. I tried it again and again, over the course of a week, trying to get better results but it just never got better. This coffee tasted like cheap diner coffee and I was unhappy with it. I emailed Cafe Altura to let them know that I was unhappy with the coffee and would like a refund, and received the most rude email back from the president of the company. I mean, I was shocked! The president basically told me that my experience with Cafe Altura was not his problem and that he would not offer me a refund. I kindly explained my whole brewing experience, and that I was not happy with the coffee, and that I simply wanted to bring this to his attention. I was very polite in my emails with him and received snarky marks, uncaring and condescending put-downs and an ego trip. I was truly shocked by the level of customer service from the president of the company. After explaining my experience, and receiving a few rude emails, my email responses went unanswered. I again, politely, asked for a refund and to date my emails are now being ignored. I will never buy this coffee again and want to spread the word to my family and friends to stay away from this coffee as well based on my experience.	1	1
1	B0028GY93S	A11EELLPLULTY8	High Quality that shows	I had to look for a new food for my 100 pound puppy.<br />She has a sensitive stomach and sheds extensively when in that phase. And as many of you know,  it is hard to find good food.<br />I have ordered 3 small bags of different food/brands, this one was the first on the list to try.<br /><br />After 2 days, the coat of my dog got better and softer too. I would have not thought that it would work so fast.<br />Poop stayed solid (I didn't have a problem with that on the previous food, but its important) and it doesn't have a nasty smell anymore, as with the previous food. Great again!<br />She still sheds a little but the coat is getting much much nicer and I am confident that it is a matter of a few more days until it is in outstanding condition.<br /><br />***After 4 days, the shine of my dogs skin is definitely noticeable. This food is high quality and it shows on your dog. We also got rid of the nasty gas which is as well a great indicator of a good food. I recommend this food over Acana, Orijen or other foods with high protein levels, as it is grain free!!! (very important).<br /><br />As for the price, Amazon is a fabulous website (& I do have Prime), however I was able to get 2 bags for $39.94/bag WITH shipping included on another website! And as I am typing this, I got additional on time 10% off .. so not even with Prime I would be able to get to that price.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as the food goes, it is very very good. Just be careful with the high protein levels, not all dogs might do well with it. Get a small bag and see how it works and of course mix it in with current food. If it doesn't work (lot of gas and loose stool after a week or more), try a different brand with less protein. You might want to look at Precise Holistic, Fromm Gold or Canidea alternatives. Very good foods but the protein is lower. Get small bags, try one, mix in little by little, if it doesn't work, go back to the previous food and than start with the other bag.<br /><br />In case of questions I will be happy to help.<br /><br />***UPDATE: So after about two weeks of use, the coat is shinier as EVER, its absolutely beautiful. The last time I remember her coat being so shiny was when she was a puppy. There is a little gas now and than, but nothing horrible (and I do feed my dog at night, so her stomach works during the night), stool is solid and still no smell. I also notice my dog shaking her head less because of ears, food CAN cause ear and eye infection, so that is satisfying too. As for the shedding, it has almost stopped. Its 80% better!!!<br /><br />This is definitely the best food we have tried in 18 months. We have tried around 10-12 different brands. That gives you an idea of how good it is. Also, it is ridiculously cheap, if you know, where to buy it. This food, under $40! is without a doubt, the best food money can buy. Well, at least for us it is.	0	0
1	B0078Y6OX8	A1TNY6V547NPCV	Decadent Coffee!	Having never sampled this flavor, I took a chance and ordered a 2 pack because it sounded so delicious.  I'm happy to say I made the right choice.  It's an excellent combination of chocolate and raspberry, where one flavor does not overpower the other.  It's my new favorite K-cup, and I will definitely buy more when this supply runs out!	0	0
1	B001EQ4LAE	A2JRSZ304OK2D1	The best gluten-free brownie mix on the market--and I've tried them all	This is easily THE best brownie mix for gluten-free diets.  We've been GF since 2005 and have tried EVERYTHING: Namaste (ick), Pamela's (meh), Bob's Red Mill (not bad), and so on.  Arrowhead Mills' mix is moist, easy to make, and my picky 8 and [...] absolutely love these brownies.  Even better, my [...], non-GF nephew ADORES these--and doesn't know they're not made with wheat.  I normally buy these mixes for [..] at an organic outlet 25 minutes away, and these boxes run [..] at larger stores, so this is a GREAT price.	2	0
1	B001216DGG	A1L56FN197JREO	Pricey but I'm Satisfied	"This is a nice bag of 1lb of different kinds of dried seaweed: wakame, aka funori, kiriboshi wakame, shiro kikurage, ito kanten, kizami hoshi kombu, according to the label.  I'm somewhat new to seaweed but there's definitely a nice variety of colors (red, white, clear, light green, dark green) and textures among the seaweed- it looks beautiful in a salad. Sixty-some dollars is alot for a pound of food but at 1/4 cup (dry) per serving of sea weed salad, this will last you a while: the bag says there's 90 quarter-cup servings in the bag.  The sea weed swells alot when soaked in warm water.  Also, I live in the middle of nowhere and I can't just run out to my local Asian supermarket to see if they have a similar product for half the price.<br /><br />The seaweed smelled nice and fresh, a gentle ocean smell- no stinky fish smell, no ""off"" flavor.  There's no sauce or seasoning on it, you make your own.  Unlike the limp salads made of wakame leaves, this seaweed mix makes a light and ""fluffy"", ""perky"" salad.  This product definitely makes a fancier, better seaweed salad than I've had at the 6 or 7 Japanese restaurants I can remember eating at.  Although, if you are looking for just dried wakame stems, this is not that product.<br /><br />I googled and found a dressing I really like, made of 3T rice vinegar, 3T soy sauce, 2T sesame seed oil, 1tsp sugar, 1tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 2 chopped scallions, all just mixed together.  (The dressing even stays good in a cup in the fridge for a week or two!)  I soak the seaweed for 10 or 15 minutes in warm water, drain, mix in the dressing, and it's ready.  To make a small amount of seaweed stretch further, I serve it on top of shredded carrot and/or shredded radish.  (I got that idea from my local Japanese restaurant.)<br /><br />Unlike Emerald Cove's 3lb wakame product, which is made in China, this 1lb sea salad is a product of Japan. The website says that it is wild-harvested along Japan's coast.  It's imported by Great Eastern Sun from Ashville NC. The label lists no preservatives or anything besides seaweed as ingredients."	9	0

Wow, good tasting and creamy just like the 'real' thing.<br /><br />The pistachio and other flavors as cheesecake and banana cream and butterscotch are surprisingly satisfying while being sugar-free/fat-free. The chocolate flavors are good, too, but don't dissolve/set as well as this does. Very easy to prepare -- and ready to eat in minutes.	2	0

-1	B001NJI7GQ	A2PBF8V7UDJ5CP	Not the greatest.	This product doesn't have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but it's hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and I'm not liking it, but it's tolerable when it's cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right.	0	0

-1	B001EQ5IPQ	A3RSPHC95H300C	ONE Coconut Water - Love / Hate Relationship	My wife really loves O.N.E Coconut Water.  I thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some.  I ordered 6 cases of 12 ea.  The first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable.  I guess a San Diego address would be undeliverable in Kentucky.  Of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition.  All the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33.8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale (really had a rancid smell).  Therefore I cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket.  Works out better, just more time consuming and heavier.  It would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy.  My wife still loves the product.	1	0
-1	B007JFMH96	A1E7BYP6JGDUHD	very dry!	For an oatmeal cookie I was very surprised at how dry these were; usually oatmeal cookies, and particularly commercially produced ones, are super soft.  Definitely needed a glass of milk to get it down.  On the positive side, there were quite a bit of almonds -- larger bits at that -- which are often promised but not delivered.  The chocolate chunks were not plentiful but I didn't mind that as much as I don't like big hunks of chocolate in my cookies; chocolate lovers might be a bit disappointed.  Due to the dryness of this cookie I wouldn't be likely to purchase these in the store as I really prefer a much moister cookie.	1	0

1	B000EH2QPQ	A6KL17KKN0A5L	My dogs love it, and love the combination beef and fish!	"I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan ""all the time"", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it."	2	0
1	B000CQ6KSI	AE7K5E1F3E6TD	Highly addictive	"This is, quite simply, the best Mac 'n Cheese on the market. It is our go-to meal for when we haven't gone to the grocery store and desperately need a dinner.<br /><br />My tips:<br />+ Add the ""optional"" butter, you know you want to.<br />+ Personally I find that it needs just the smallest pinch of salt to bring out its flavors<br />+ Some fresh ground pepper rounds it out<br /><br />If you like this stuff, I also highly recommend the Annie's snack mix (I think also available on Amazon). I believe Annie's makes both products with their patented Bunny Cocaine(tm). The dangerous addiction I've developed is totally worth it."	3	0

They are great and we love them.	0	0
-1	B002DLXXHG	A6B3PDKSC9DF2	Good price, OK quality	This jerky tastes okay, but it seems like this isn't made from the best quality meat.  I don't know if I got a bad batch, but all the jerky I ate had hard veins running through them. All in all, I would give 2.5 stars, but since I can't, and I don't like rounding up, I have to go with 2.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The Jerky is tender, but not overly tender.  It is a good consistancy (except for the occassional tough fiber running through them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />The quality of the meat was sub par, which says a lot, since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky (its basically dried ground meat).  As the other reviewers pointed out, the package says the beef could be from USA or from a variety of other countries.  I'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the US.<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br />The flavor was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  There are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor.	0	0
-1	B001IVVUTU	A1JI9MZF0ZN85P	Worst root beer ever.	My kids and I love root beer and I brew my own from time to time. Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it, all I can say is don't waste your time. It has little to no root beer flavor,it finishes a little spicy in fact. It has caffine added which was a bit of a put off as well. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this product. If you want a pick me up and you don't mind it tasting like sugar water mixed with dish soap then this is the drink for you.	1	3

1	B001EO5RMM	ATMQEI1LKR6VB	Real stevia extract with no additives	This is real stevia extract without any additives. Most of the companies that claim to be selling stevia are really selling stevia extract combined with other things, like fiber or artificial sweeteners, but this is the real deal. It's extremely sweet, which means you only have to use a small amount at a time, and you should melt it with hot water if you plan to put it in a cold drink. Stevia also tastes a little . . . different. (Some describe it as tasting like licorice, but I never thought so). I suggest starting with the smallest amount and then upping the quantity until you find a level of sweetness that tastes good to you. Because of stomach problems, this is the only sweetener I use, and I like it very much. I highly recommend it.	3	0
1	B00503DP0O	ABQY6SUEEU12Q	These are SOOO delicious!!!!	I've tried all flavors of Pamela's Whenever Bars, & all of them taste good in my opinion. However, if you're more of a chocolate-lover like me, these are THE BEST! :-) They are relatively low in sugar (8 grams per bar), wheat-free, gluten-free & non-dairy but honestly taste very much like a chocolate chip cookie!! They have a good amount of whole grains & some Omega 3's as well. The taste of other brands' bars I've tried pale in comparison!	0	0
1	B000F47E00	A3CM3GMHM3QJSP	Great value!	I have a small gourmet catering business and have a couple of dessert items I use vanilla beans for.  One recipe calls for 3 full vanilla beans for each recipe!  One can image how expensive that would be at $4 - $6 per bean!  This Melissa's box was an incredible buy at just over $1 per bean...the beans are supple and their flavor is very good.  As another reviewer mentioned, they are not the most coveted bean but for most purposes they are excellent!  I highly recommend this purchase for anyone who uses a lot of vanilla beans or who can find someone to share them with.  I don't know how long they will remain fresh because I haven't had that issue, but as quickly as I use them, I don't expect to.  This is a tremendous value!!	0	0
1	B0009JMW1C	A15ZLXABTK8F3F	THIS PRODUCT WORKS!	Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.	1	0

In viewing this item at the time of purchase it didn't appear that any of the yellow plastic caps came loose.The picture made it appear all the caps stayed in the cups and twirled around. Then the instructions warn not to leave your dog alone with this toy. My whole purpose was to leave my dog alone and I wouldn't have to worry about any of the plastic caps coming loose. Actually, I'm sorry I bought it. However, I bought two of the squirrels in the tree trunk toys, one for me and one for a friend, and we're very happy with them.	0	0

Love the smoky flavorl  I recommend you buy it straight from Keruig, as a member (which is free) you can get a box of 24 for 17.24.  I always order 3 boxes at a time and get free shipping.  Also like the Italian roast, but is a bit stronger and, I think, harsher flavor.  Where ever you end up buying Prima French Roast, you'll come back for more!	0	0

1	B000G6MBX2	A1WX42M589VAMQ	So Faboo: Dangerous for those prone to Chips Binges!!!	I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir	3	1
1	B0000GGI00	A2VBTN6ZR67YOF	What everyone is saying here about Pico Pica is true	"This is a very different sauce - nothing like anything you'll find in the grocery store. It's closer to the ""botique"" salsas that have recently appeared with the new ""taco restaurant"" trend. It's a little smokey. My picky 3-year old will eat a burrito with this on it. My family always had this (mild) on the table in Southern California and now that I've been transplanted in South Florida I am happy to mail-order. You can get the little single-serve pouches directly from the company, too."	1	0

1	B00503DP0O	A1FEVNKKDXU5NA	Delightful Snack/Dessert	I had no reason to buy a gluten-free bar, but the reviews won me over. These are incredible! They taste great -- chocolatey with hints of coconut -- and they actually stave off my hunger for more than twenty minutes, which no snack bar has ever done. Even shortly after eating something like a clif bar I'm ready to gnaw someone's arm off. I'll eat one of these before I go for a long run; it doesn't weigh me down, but I have something in me so I don't feel nauseous afterward. I bought these on sale, but I think I'm going to take the plunge and buy them at the non-sale price. That in itself is an amazing review coming from me.	0	0
1	B007M83302	AHS0PKJQWMM73	Great Snack	We really like this relatively healthy snack.

1	B000CMHMUC	A2ZNC6RKT720P6	I Love Soy Crisps	I love light crispy salty snacks, and Soy Crisps is the best one of those I've found.  At only 100 calories per serving/350 calories for the bag, you could literally eat the entire bag (which I do on a regular basis) and not feel bad about it.<br /><br />There are several flavors but Deep Sea Salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soy.<br /><br />So delish!  Shipped fast with all crisps in tact.  Great purchase, re-ordering.	1	0

1	B001BR9B92	A3U3BS4ULCX68Z	Like being home...	After moving from the bay area to Louisiana, we found we couldn't find salami here. Well, not real salami anyway. That processed flavor added pre-sliced stuff that taste horrible, is even hard to find. We ordered this since we couldn't find a way to order what we usually got back in California, on line. While not quite the same flavor as we were accustomed to, it is still really good salami. It has a bit of a nutty flavor unlike our old usual salami. The pepper in it isn't as uniformly distributed in some of the chubs, some bites will have a stronger pepper flavor than others, but not too strong to make them any less delicious. Unfortunately, the cooling packs that were in the box broke and water logged everything in it. This seems to make the casing with the mold on it hard to remove--I would suggest overnight shipping if you plan on ordering, to avoid this. Five pounds of salami came to 15 little 7 and a half inch chubs, with a refrigerator life of about 2 to 3 months. This is a bit much for two people to eat; unless you eat salami like my wife and I do. This amount would be perfect for a party of 8 to 12 people if that is what you are looking for. Just make sure to slice them thin. If you are one of those unfortunate people who have never had a chub of salami, only the pre-sliced packaged stuff, you really should try this. It's like the difference between good cheese and processed cheese food. While both serve a purpose, only one is edible by itself. Add a bit of provolone and a club cracker and this salami is heaven in every bite!!	3	0

1	B002C4HZ00	A2DYMDOAJURO5F	Best value for the genuine article IF you have PRIME	"There is much confusion about tomatoes, and shopping on-line in this case adds to the complexity.  These are not the best tomatoes offered at the time of this writing.  The Strianese are hands down the best.  My local store sells them.  I have been using them for fifteen years.  But they are significantly more expensive and the shipping is brutal.  No Prime shipping with them.  I use these specific Cento when I am not home.  It all depends on how much your sauce means to you.<br /><br />But you need to know what you are buying.  These Cento tomatoes are 1) San Marzano sauce tomatoes; 2) they are D.O.P. certified 3) and this point is often overlooked, they are from the Sarnese Nocerino.  They are the second best in terms of absolute flavor.  Bright from proper acid, deep from proper natural salt/sugar balance.  You probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower, or do it yourself and have no day job.  Cento sells many others, much cheaper, that are not these.<br /><br />The price per can is good.  The best deal is if you have Amazon Prime and get regular shipments.  I get three large batches per case, enough to feed the mob that forms on sauce day.<br /><br />Most people are happy with the many good canned tomatoes, especially when you look at the poor genetically engineered ersatz ""fresh"" tomatoes at the supermarket.  But if you are a maestro, these are what you want."	17	0

She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store).  When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't ""meet their quality"" guidelines.  When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs, the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their ""support group"" (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group).

What Amazon has sent me is NOT<br />edible in my opinion.

1	B0001GUQ20	A1QI7Z2DAZG11O	THE BEST SO FAR	This is amazing stuff. The Minor's bases were recommended to me by one of the instructors at the New Orleans School of Cooking. He used some of the chicken base to make the eight cups of stock he used in a gumbo he was demonstrating. I've tried the beef and the chicken, and both are superb. They have a flavor that is identical to home made stock. The stuff keeps forever. Give any of the Minors bases a try and you will be sold. The only problem is the ridiculous shipping charge from Soupbase, the vendor. It's almost as much as the cost of the product.	9	0

This is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed.  Most soda doesn't have this much sugar, the 8.3 oz can has 29 grams of sugar, yikes!

So far the Peach Passion is the favorite and the kitchen smells of peaches when I make this one.  It is so good I'm signing up for auto delivery.<br /><br />If you like peaches and tea, this is the blend for you.<br /><br />As a side note I add about a 1 tablespoon of quality black tea to the 8 tablespoons of Peach Passion.  Also, I can brew this twice and still get full flavor (24 cups total).	1	0

1	B001CD1VI4	A3HY6C05DIMNP7	Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies	"So far, I have tried caramel apple, fruit & nut, morning glory, and banana walnut flavers. I have also ordered, (but not yet received) the pumpkin spice cookies. All of them are an excellent meal replacement or nutritious snack. The ingredients are wholesome, there is no high fructose corn syrup, and they have a good supply of protein & fiber to stave off hunger for several hours. The caramel apple is probably my favorite because it seems to be the moistest, but I really love all of the flavors. Like other reviewers, I freeze them, and then microwave a cookie for 20 seconds when I am ready to eat it. I find the cookies taste best warmed up. Even though the calorie count is higher than many cookies, I think you get a lot of nutritional ""value"" with these."	4	1
1	B005DVVAH8	A298GL2D0BHGKZ	So Freaking Good!	Whom ever came up with the idea to dip pretzels in yogurt, was either high, a genious, or the devil himself..probably all.<br /><br />Point is, these things are so freaking good! The right amount of salt and sweet on each pretzel, it's hard to stop eating them, so a word of caution, for every 8 pretzels you eat, you get 11gm of sugar, and so people trying to lose weight or in any sort of special diet, should pay extra attention when or before eating these.<br /><br />There's absolutely nothing negative to say about this product. The bags (6 of them) came well packaged and the pretzels taste fresh. I can't really give this product a low score due to its sugar content, etc., because I knew what I was buying and expected it to be this way. Hope this helps.	1	0

While this is packaged well and convenient to open and pour out, it doesn't matter how easy it is<br />or how healthy if you can't get the baby to eat it! This is extremely blah, bland mush. I certainly<br />expected much better from this brand. In addition, since it's a stage 3 food, I expected there to be<br />pieces of meat and vegetables, however there's just a bunch of lightish brown mush my baby wont eat<br />even why I try to force it down her.

-1	B000DZFMEQ	A1XRUVR65N4NJ4	May cause discomfort	I tried many gluten free breads. Flavor-wise, this bread is good. But the real issue I had with this bread is that it caused me quite a lot of discomfort because of bloating and gas. Yes, it's awkward to admit that, but I wanted to warn others from potential painful symptoms.<br /><br />I have celiac as well as ulcerative colitis, so my digestive system is sensitive. I bought the 6-pack from amazon, and with the first loaf I baked I thought the symptoms might be related to something else I ate. By the second loaf my suspicion grew stronger. With the third, I decided to do a little experiment and just eat the bread by itself and see if it's really the source of the discomfort/gas. The answer is yes.<br /><br />I should note that I did not have these symptoms with Bob's red mill<br />gluten free bread (which is also tasty). There is definitely something in Pam's bread mix that the digestive system of some people might disagree with.<br /><br />Hope it help,	7	0

Amazon was the only place I could find besides the manufacturer that would sell me this at retail.

It enables me to buy the food at a price that is acceptable and keeps my cats happy at the same time.<br /><br />As far as the food itself is concerned all I can say is that the cats love it, and it gives them very healthy looking luxurious coats and satisfies their appetites at the same time.

-1	B0013NUGDE	A3VNL3FSJK7ISG	Healthy really?	"I was excited to buy these ""chips"" and try them out since they are supposed to be a healthier alternative. But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil, it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w/ the baked chips!"	0	2

1	B003VVL8NS	AYC3Y4QX7GATV	Delightful Revival of an Old Favorite (if wrapper is all wrong)	"I definitely remember buying Turkish Taffy in all four flavors (Vanilla, Bananna, Chocolate, and yes, Strawberry) for $0.05 at our local drugstore when I was a wee lad. I took a bit of a haitus because I became an adult (sort of), and because the Bonomos stopped making it. But I never forgot the wonderful flavors and consistency of the taffy; my favorite was the bananna.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I saw Turkish Taffy for sale at our local County Fair last week! It was for sale for $1.59 almost 32X more expensive than it was thirty five years ago. But the flavor is right on (bananna and vanilla), and the consistency is excellent. I was able to break it up into nice pieces at room temperature with a few well placed whacks! The secret is to hit it several times at different places along the length of the bar against a hard, rounded or ""blunt"" object, such as the edge of a curb or a stair railing. Don't smack it against a flat surface. I was willing to overlook the incredible inflated price (Note; its cheaper here on Amazon - $1/bar if you get a 24-count box) and I enjoyed several bars.<br /><br />The only thing spoiling a very nice effort by the folks currently distributing the product is that the wrapper is all wrong. Either they didn't bother to do their reserach, or more likley, they are hoping we will overlook what is probably a large cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. Today's product is wrapped in a plastic sleeve that has a seam running down the back and is sealed on both ends. As millions of people my age know, this kind of wrapper makes it very difficult to get at the chunks, particularly the small ones, that you have just created inside the covering.<br /><br />The old wrapper was foil with the color matching the flavor on the outside (yellow for bananna, etc.), and silver metallic color on the inside. The metallic wrapper could be gently unfolded first on the ends, and then along the middle to expose 100% of the marvelous, freshly broken taffy...and then folded back up and stuffed into your pocket!! Very important for those quick getaways on your bike. (That might have had a bananna seat...)<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF STARS AWARDED:<br />**** for the effort to reintroduce Turkish Taffy + * for nice flavor - * for lousy wrapper + * for outstanding breakability = ***** Basically, the product quality trumps the lousy wrapper in my opinion, although I discovered its not a good idea to stuff a half-eaten bar wrapped in cheap plastic into your suitcoat pocket. So if you're listening Bonomo People, please bring back the foil wrapper. With the 20X price increase (based on Amazon's price for a box), there's got to be a little profit margin in there for the original, authentic foil. Really."	10	0
1	B0078Y6OX8	A2QROUMA7CXGJV	YUMMY	My husband is very picky when it come to flavored coffee.  He found that this was just PERFECT.. Not too strong or weak on Flavor	0	0
-1	B004K30HO2	AWTCBU3VCS6JS	Do Not Buy	The Solo K-cup works perfectly instead of these.  I Totally agree with the Poor Performance review.  I also got coffee grounds in my cup everytime I used these (yes even with the filter). The cup is poorly designed. It clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit.	1	1
-1	B001AW9PTO	AXXBTBXEHB9SQ	maybe I got a bad batch	I buy jerky all the time, always willing to try something new. I've even made my own at home. I agree with the review that called these salt sticks, they are way too salty for my taste. Also, being a jerky eater for 40+ years, I eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk. But the tube I got was nearly un-chewable. I have bit into some hard jerky in my time, but jeez louise, these were literally like chewing leather, many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite.	1	2
1	B007M83302	A1GS8K0TSHCX84	Popchips are amazing!	An entire bag of the 3-ounce Popchips are only 360 calories and are very low in fat. I can snack on this or even replace lunch with some of them. There is just the right amount of salt and, despite being produced very unlike traditional chips, the expected crunch is still present. The only complaint I have is that the material of the chip is actually fairly coarse and if you're eating them quickly, I find the roof of my mouth gets a little raw.	0	0

1	B0007A0PX0	A239D6FZHF13QE	Very convenient!	This is not an instant tea mix.  This actually powdered green tea leaves. Hence the cloudiness.  This product is convenient to mix into my water bottle that I take to the gym.  The finest green tea from an antioxidant perspective is Matcha green tea. It's the tea used in scientific studies that touts green tea's antioxidant properties.  It's very expensive but is grown in special areas in japan.<br /><br />I feel this is the next best thing.  It dissolves easily and I can take it with me and add to water on the go. I use match a when I'm at home, but this beats buying bottled green tea in quality and it's much more economical.	1	0

-1	B000YSS7EO	A2DE3CTDXQPWXV	Not so happy mommy	While I typically like the Happy baby products, I was very disappointed with this product. Unfortunately when I opened the first of six containers it smelled stale as if it had been sitting on the shelf for a very long time. I decided to mix up a bowl but after tasting a bite, it confirmed my initial thought--it was old despite the expiration date. My guess is that I received a bum batch however, I am not willing to try it again when there are other organic cereals I have been happy with.<br /><br />I will say I was extremely pleased with Amazon's customer service. Although this item was non-returnable, they still issued a refund to me promptly.	0	0

-1	B001LG945O	A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ	Tastes like soap.	This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.<br /><br />What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough.	2	2
1	B008ZRKZSM	AHDOV721XZ7DG	Yum!	"This is great stuff!  You can use in place of peanut butter in lots of ways and the calorie difference really helps the waistline!

Also use it in wraps for a ""thai"" flavor and in smoothies - yum!"	2	0
1	B000EM6PC6	A212B4HST8SVLY	Lipton Loose Tea	I love the Loose Tea. The bag tea has a harsh taste compared To the loose tea. If you drink more than 1 cup a day use a CLEAN (never used for Coffee) Coffee pot. Small 4 cup pots only need 1 tea spoon for weaker a little more for stronger tea.	1	0

1	B001E5DZTS	AXBVJH9YYBFYZ	Excellent alternate infant formula	"This goat's milk has been a godsend for our granddaughter who seemed to get sick on every formula we tried.  The goat milk with a little coconut oil and extra DHA became a fantastic infant formula.  Once she started using the goat milk, almost all of her ""issues"" resolved themselves.  Her skin cleared up completely and her scalp didn't look all scaly and dry.  She looked like the perfect child we knew her to be!  She's now 7 months and has been using it since she's a month old.  She has been growing beautifully and perfectly on this powdered goat milk.  The powder is very convenient too.  Twenty years ago my nephew used goat milk in place of cow's milk and also did great!  His allergies also became a thing of the past.  All I can say is this is an excellent product!"	3	0
1	B000LRH7HG	A2MOS6K0NLXAEG	Gyros Anytime!	I love a great gyros platter, but there aren't many Greek restaurants/pizzarias where I live.  So I was excited to see this offered here!  The meat was still frozen when it arrived, and the styrofoam-lined shipping box can be reused, ice packs and all.  I bought it pre-sliced, and the slices separate easily from each other in the box so you can keep it frozen and just use a little at a time.  My only complaint is that I like thicker slices; but in terms of flavor, well, I challenge you to make it at home yourself and have it taste this good.  I have a feeling I will keep a box of this on hand from now on.  One note:  the box does not contain heating instructions.  I tried it in the broiler and over-browned it.  I wish I had read the instructions here before that first attempt!	0	0
1	B000255OIG	A1KJH57UFCFUN0	dogs love these!	My two boxes absolutely LOVE these freeze dried liver treats; it is one of their favorites.  Both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off.  The only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily.  (But, I guess that's not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat)	0	0

1	B000KV61FC	AD3G203JHBH0	A good little toy for every 4 legged good little girl and boy	I heard the inventor on a local radio station one day Talking about her Boston terrier who tore up all his toys and she said that's why she invented this. I was a little unsure that this would keep my little # 3 BT  busy, but it does. It also keeps #2 BT busy, but #1 BT just wants you to shake the treats out. The only problem I have is finding treats small enough to work in it. Sometimes I just put their dog food in it and they still love to play with it. I definitely would recommend this dog toy to anyone who very active dogs it does keep them busy.	0	0

The Nut Delight bar is a mildly sweet, solid bar of whole nuts (even the brazil nuts are whole!) --bound together by whatever glaze makes them slightly sweeter than the individual nuts mixed together would be--yet you get few of the carbs you'd expect with such a treat.

1	B001P05K8Q	A1Q7EM0982HB9C	Really awesome!	Our golden retriever LOVES these!!  We've tried other dental treats/chews in the past without luck.

We give him one of these every other day, and his gums and teeth look AMAZING!  I'm really excited that he has a treat he loves that's also good for his dental hygiene.

This is the experience I shared with my friends. After this purchase I bought books from Walmart on line for the first time."	4	3
1	B004AVFVWC	AY12DBB0U420B	Yum! Really Good! Now I Understand!	I enjoy shopping in a local Fresh and Easy Market because they have so many and such unusual imported items. They're a British company and most of their imported stuff is from England. Take this Heinz Classic Cream of Tomato Soup. Supposedly it has been made and sold for over 100 years. Well, if figured there had to be something good about it to import it when there are so many similar brands easily available. I was right. This stuff is really good. Yum! It might be more expensive, but man it's much better. Real rich savory taste. Low in fat and sodium. Tastes great with a lunch. Now I understand<br /><br />Gary Peterson	0	0

1	B002RJD2XY	A1XQMQMF07QZQS	Cook up to be whole beans in a jiffy	These are perfect if you want to add some beans to another soup, or just to have any size portion of black beans right away. As they are dried, they last forever, and you can have any portion size you want. With a little water and microwave, they perk up to give you really good quality black beans. I like these better than canned black beans, and I don't have any more at any time than I want. Adding them to soups which are too watery is a great way to thicken them up. You can't do that with canned beans which are mostly water in the first place. I haven't calculated the price out, but these are probably not any more expensive than canned beans because you aren't buying any water. Would be perfect for camping food as well.	0	0

It was awful.  I've had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this.  It is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced.

1	B000SATIGO	A1L2Z1O7KG13NP	Tasty. Not 'bland', but not as strong as other Assam teas.	"This Assam tea is delicious, and a good deal, especially for organic and fair trade. I will say that I expected it to have a bolder flavor, which I am used to with other Assam teas I have tried. It has the same flavor characteristics of other Assam teas - it just doesn't brew dark and strong even with a lot of leaves in the infuser. That said, I am enjoying this somewhat more delicate Assam tea a lot, and the price was right. The listing promises ""fair trade certified"" and ""certified organic"", but the label on the bag doesn't have any fair trade certification. Hopefully the advertising is correct."	0	0

Again, I did not expect this product to be great....I am not a picky person, but this stuff right here is just plain nasty. The only GOOD I can say is the noodles were of nice consistency.
